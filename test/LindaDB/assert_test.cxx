    /**
     * \brief A function to capture output to an std::ostream.
     *
     * A function that can be used to capture all data output to the OStrm std::ostream object in string
     * format, as if it were to appear on wherever the stream was connected to.
     * It swaps the stream buffer under the stream allowing it to hijack all output. Note, that during
     * this function, the normal behavior of the stream may be compromised, for example, std::cout will
     * not write to STDOUT.
     * This is useful in case of only `std::ostream` objects that are not also `std::istream`-s, since
     * one cannot just read data from an `std::ostream`.
     *
     * The function is *not* thread safe.
     *
     * \tparam OStrm The std::ostream object to hijack. Passed as a pointer.
     * \tparam Fn The type of the function to execute while the stream is captured. Perfect forwarded.
     * \tparam Args The type of arguments passed to the executed function. Perfect forwarded.
     * \param fn The function to execute during the redirected stream state.
     * \param args The of arguments passed to the executed function.
     * \return The string data that would've been written to wherever the stream was connected.
