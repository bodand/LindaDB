     * ACK TAG: Since multiple acks could arrive from the same host,
     *          and their ordering is not guaranteed to be in the correct
     *          order, (eval#1r1 sends remove, eval#2r1 sends try_remove,
     *          neither are in the db, thus we need to make sure eval#1n1
     *          does not catch the ack of eval#2n1, and since are both on
     *          rank 1 (*r1), the basic MPI sender, receiver int value does
     *          not help) so everyone waits a special ack value which they
     *          send to r0 to reply to their answer with. This is a special
     *          bitmap, stuffed into an MPI tag, ie. an int.
     *          However, the MPI specification only guarantees the value
     *          range of a 16-bit int. (Which is valid, considering that is
     *          allowed in C and C++ as well.)
     *          Therefore, even if a given platform has 32 bit ints, an
     *          MPI implementation is not guaranteed to provide support for
     *          using the upper 16 bits...

     *    bits:  |0123456789012345|
     *   value:  |XDMMMMMMMMMMMMMM|
     *  legend:   X : 1 = 0, a zero bit to ensure the tags are not negative,
     *                       since those are reserved for internal MPI messages
     *            D : 1 = 1, the special bit of ack messages, otherwise there
     *                       could be collisions with other communication_tag
     *                       tag values (normal messages have D = 0)
     *            M : 15, the message differentiator, a monotonically
     *                    increasing value, per rank, that wraps around
     *                    when it reached its maximum value.
     *
     *          Since each rank gets sent back their own message tag, each
     *          tag only needs to be unique within a given rank, and not
