#   Postgres based db backend: contains two subprojects:
#    - pglinda: a PostgreSQL plugin, which provides the custom datatypes required
#               for modelling the Linda data-model in Postgres, uses Postgres
#               server development files
#    - lindapq: a static library, that is linked into LindaRT providing the
#               postgres based backend to LindaRT, uses libpq
