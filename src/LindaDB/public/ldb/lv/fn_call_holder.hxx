         *
         * \remarks
         * This is constructor has a semi-weird interface, as the tuple
         * needs to pack two different pieces of information: the first
         * element in the tuple must be a value of the return type of the
         * function called, while the remaining values are the values with
         * which the function was invoked.
         *
         * \remarks
         * The first element's value is unused, only required to allow the
         * reconstruction of the function's type on the other process when
         * the call is actually performed.
         *
         * \remarks
         * The rationale is with the fight against the circular dependency
         * between the linda_tuple and fn_call_holder. This is fixed by the
         * unique_ptr, and a forward declaration above this class, but this
         * does not allow the separation of the first linda_value entity into
         * a new parameter, unless we take another pointer to a linda_value,
         * which does waste resources. Considering this is an internal
         * interface, this is deemed a bigger problem than a slightly irritating
         * interface design. (Also the large documentation block should make
         * it obvious that something is up.)
